  <p>Before we get into the good stuff ill tell you alittle about my background.
    I was born in Mexico City on April 20th 1995, I was born into a lower middle class family.
    Both of my parents and I share a deep love towards animals of all sizes.
    When i was about 7 years old my mother and I moved to the U.S. with my father.
    I whent to school in the U.S. and found another one of my passions while in school... Football!.
    After a few years I had came back to Mexico and I can honestly say that it's been the greatest experience of my life.

  <p>I've been trainign dogs for about 4 years now. I love working with dogs, the most loyal animal of all.
    I can not for the life of me remember the first interaction i had with a dog and thats because
    I've been around dogs since day 1. I love dogs that have a porpouse, police, military, rescue, etc.
    I've had many dog breeds in the past, but my top 5 favorite breeds have to be.
