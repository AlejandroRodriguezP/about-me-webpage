    <h2>Introduction</h2></center>
  <p>Before we get into the good stuff ill tell you alittle about my background. I was born in Mexico City on April 20th 1995, I was born into a lower middle class family. Both of my parents and I share a deep love towards animals of all sizes. When i was
    about 7 years old my mother and I moved to the U.S. with my father. I whent to school in the U.S. and found another one of my passions while in school... Football!. After a few years I had came back to Mexico and I can honestly say that it's been
    the greatest experience of my life. This is just a small teaser, if you want to know alittle more about me keep reading below.

  <center><em><h2>Dogs</h2></em></center>
  <p>I've been trainign dogs for about 4 years now. I love working with dogs, the most loyal animal of all. I can not for the life of me remember the first interaction i had with a dog and thats because I've been around dogs since day 1. I love dogs that
    have a porpouse, police, military, rescue, etc. I've had many dog breeds in the past, but my top 5 favorite breeds have to be.

  <center><em><h2>School & Football</h2></em></center>
  <p>Before moving to the U.S. I used to go to private school, to be more specific I whent to catholic school. I didnt play sports before moving to the U.S., when I was in 4th grade a teacher of mine asked me if I was intrested in playing football. It was
    before summer break, i whent home and told my father and well that fall i played my first season. That changed me forever, I learned how to catch and block, but the most importat thing I learned was how to be a team player.

  <center><em>Earthships & Aquaponis!?</em></center>
  <p>Yes, earthship!, not many people are familiar with the modern "earthship" but building one from scratch is a huge dream for me.
  An earthship is a home made out of natural and/or reciclyed materials, most earthships are of grid meaning they dont need energy or water from private or govenrment sorces.
  I love earthships, i love the idea of building something from the ground up and not only that you're also saving the earth by getting rid of tires and other materials that pollute our land and waters.
  This might sound alittle "hippie" but i truely worry about the world for our future generations. Now, let us talk about food. Aquaponis is very similar to hydroponics, they both use hydrogen to grow plants.
  The following will give some idea on what both aquaponics and hydroponics are

   <ul> style= "list-style-type: none; display: inline-block;">
   <li>Uses fish and bacteria in a closed loop system</li>
   <li>Water and nutrients are usually never purged</li>
   <li>Things grown taste like real food and are usually more nutritious</li>

 </ul>
